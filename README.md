# item-282 (wip)

It's that time of year again. The UofC is having its annual scavenger hunt and this is my small contribution.

For item 282, the judges have requested "the most average census tract in America. We want to see the GEOID, a description of your rigorous yet creatively innovative methodology, and an illustrative map"

## Methodology

1. Understand the problem
As is the case with most scav items, I had no idea what this meant upon the first several readings. So I asked friends, and then emailed the customer service branch of the United State Census Bureau. Apparently, the US Census Bureau employs individuals who are both lovely _and_ helpful. Here is their response:

Hi Liz,

Thank you for contacting us. That sounds an interesting project. I can think of a few resources that might help you out, which I'll list below.

You could use our Gazetteer Files for Census Tracts to get land area values for each one. You could then find a national average, and then search for a tract or tract that's close to that value. Here's the download page: https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html.

You may have come across this already, but here's some info about census tracts, themselves: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/about/glossary.html#par_textimage_13. Their population varies, with an optimal of 4,000. You can use American Fact Finder (https://factfinder.census.gov) or data.census.gov to find population data by census tract. The Response Outreach Area Mapper might also be useful. It's an interactive mapping tool with population and other demographic data by tract: https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2017/geo/roam.html.

I hope this is helpful. Please let us know if you have any additional questions.

Best Regards,

Meredith
